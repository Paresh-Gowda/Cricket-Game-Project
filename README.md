# 🏏 Cricket Game

This is a simple web-based Cricket Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is inspired by the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors logic but themed around cricket, where the player and computer choose between "Bat", "Ball", or "Stump". 
The winner is decided based on predefined rules, and the scores are tracked and stored using localStorage.

The game has a user-friendly interface with image buttons for each move, and it displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, the result of the round, and the overall score.
The score persists even if the page is refreshed, and there's also a reset button to clear all progress.
It’s a great beginner-level project to understand event handling, conditional logic, and browser storage using JavaScript.
